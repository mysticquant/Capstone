Readme

There are two parts.

Part 1 is the insample testing which was shown upto the Interim report.


The zipped folder contains three code files.

1. Regime_Detection.py - The main file to be run first. Could be opened in either in Spyder or could be run 
from the command prompt by issuing python <filename>
2. Output_HMM.py - Once the Regime_Detection.py file is run, then the next step is to run this file. This has to be 
run in a different python session. Best is to use command prompt to run this file.
3. HMM_func.R - This file need not be run. This is just to show how the HMM model was fitted in R. The R package
appears to be superior to the one in python. It is more robust.

Python version used - 2.7 (64 bit) in Anaconda
Libaries - pickle, matplotlib, six, numpy, pandas, datetime, scipy, hmmlearn, warnings, re

If any of the library is missing the library can be manually installed by issuing command pip install <package-name>


Input files necessary for runing the Python files

1. HMM.csv - Hidden Markov Model for S&P 500 generated by R 
2. GSPC - S&P 500 market data
3. history.csv - EDHEC hedge fund returns

Part2 is the out of sample testing which is the work done after Interim report.
This uses the QStrader framework. A detailed information on how to set up QSTrader is given in the Solution Design Report.

The only file that needs to be run is regime_hmm_backtest.py Modifications can be done in this file to change symbols,
model and time period, the details of which is elaborated in the Solution Design. Please read the solution design to understand
the setup

The folder structure should be the same . There should be a data folder where the csv files are kept. And an out folder 
where the results are outputted.

Sometimes there might be a problem because the yahoo fix is not always working . The yahoo fix will retun no data . Wait for sometime
and rerun until you get the entire SPY data.
